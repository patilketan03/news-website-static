The decision continues the seamer’s gradual withdrawal from cricket – the 37-year-old left England’s Test side last summer to prioritise the white-ball game, retired from regional and county cricket in January and announced in February, after England lost to South Africa in the T20 World Cup semi-finals, that she had played her last global tournament – and means her active involvement is now limited to the Hundred.</p>
